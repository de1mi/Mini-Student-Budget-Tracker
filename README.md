# Mini-Student-Budget-Tracker
A simple Python program designed to help students track their income and expenses. This budget tracker provides financial insights, alerts on overspending, and suggests ways to save money effectively.

## Features
- 💰 *Income & Expense Tracking*: Input your income and key expenses.
- ⚠️ *Overspending Alerts*: Get notified when you exceed your budget.
- 📊 *Savings Recommendation*: See how much of your income you can save.
- 🎯 *Expense Breakdown*: Identify areas where you can cut costs.
- 🔄 *Repeat Execution*: Option to run the tracker multiple times.

## How It Works
1. The user enters their *income*.
2. They input expenses such as *rent, food, savings, transport, and subscriptions*.
3. The program calculates total expenses and compares them to the income.
4. If expenses exceed income, the user gets *warnings* about overspending.
5. If they have remaining funds, the program suggests *how much they can save*.
6. The user can choose to rerun the program.
